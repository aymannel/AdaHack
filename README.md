### **NFC-Powered Peer-to-Peer Payment Settlements**

**Problem:**
Casual debts among friends (like rounds at the pub) often go unpaid because there’s no frictionless, fee-free way to settle them. Existing contactless payment systems rely on acquiring banks, introducing fees and unnecessary intermediaries.

**Goal:**
Make casual debt settlement intuitive, fee-free, and as easy as tapping a sticker.

**Solution:**
A peer-to-peer payment system that uses NFC to initiate bank-to-bank transfers directly—bypassing acquiring banks. It functions like a physical interface for debt settlement, combining the simplicity of tap-to-pay with the delayed-settlement flexibility of Splitwise.

**How it works:**
* Users register in-app, link a payment method (e.g. Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal) and receiving account (bank details).
* Each user gets an NFC sticker or uses their phone’s NFC.
* Either party can initiate or request a payment by tapping phones or scanning the other’s NFC tag, entering the amount, and approving the transaction.

**Example Scenarios:**
1. A taps B’s NFC, sends £10.
2. B scans A’s NFC, requests £10; A gets a notification to approve/decline.

**Core Requirements:**
* Physical NFC sticker or phone-based tag
* In-app ordering and registration
* NFC ID is paired with the user’s device/account
* Linked payment and receiving methods
